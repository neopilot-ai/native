---

### üß™ Evaluation System

- [x] Expand `scorer.py` with:

- [ ] Add support for build tools that use the Remote Execution protocol, such as:
  - [ ] Bazel
  - [ ] Buck2
  - [ ] Goma
  - [ ] Reclient
- [x] Content Addressable Storage (CAS) - Minimize redundant compilation of unchanged source code for compute-efficient builds
- [x] Conceptual Remote Execution Client/Service Outline
- [x] Add `prompt_runner.py` CLI to simulate agent execution flow
- [x] Log agent conversations as `.md` or `.jsonl` in `logs/`
- [x] CLI wrapper for `auto_commit_agent.py` with `--all` flag
- [x] Generate project documentation (conceptual)

---

## ü§ñ AI-Orchestrated Development Workflows

- [x] Implement AI-assisted multi-agent orchestration
- [x] Define LLM-A (code generator), LLM-B (reviewer), LLM-C (synthesizer), LLM-D (supervisor)
- [x] Chain agents using feedback and validation loops
- [x] Enable cross-agent tool access (e.g., edit_file_tool, read_file_tool)
- [x] Build meta_prompting/prompt_strategies.py for:
  - [x] Minimalist Prompting
  - [x] Modular Decomposition Prompts
  - [x] Multi-Shot + Chain-of-Thought guidance
  - [x] Socratic Prompting
- [x] Create prompt registry and evaluation system
- [x] Track prompt ‚ÜîÔ∏è result lineage
- [x] Score prompts by clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness
- [ ] Automate GitOps tasks via agents:
  - [x] AI-generated commit messages, PR titles, and release notes
  - [x] Code linting and formatting via Prettier, ESLint, Black
  - [x] CI/CD pipeline suggestions using GitHub Actions

---

## üß¨ Future Vision

- [x] MVP GUI/TUI with Iced.rs or Tauri (`apps/shell/`)
- [x] Plugin system for tools / agents / scorers
- [x] Long-term hierarchical context store (CRDT/IPFS-based)
- [x] Interactive Workflow Debugging/Stepping
- [x] Dynamic Tool Discovery and Integration
- [x] Knowledge Graph / Ontology Integration
- [x] Made With Love In Rust - Reduce runtime errors, guarantee memory-safety without requiring garbage collection, & eliminate race conditions at any scale.

---

## üöÄ New Feature: FAANG-Level AI Developer Mode

- [x] Design and embed a multi-layered system prompt simulating a Principal Engineer's discipline, tech stack, and workflows
- [x] Create a JSON prompt template for loading as system context in AI tools
- [x] Implement logic to load and apply the JSON system prompt in your AI call pipeline (e.g., OpenAI API, Ollama)
- [x] Combine system prompt with task-specific user prompts for recursive file analysis, refactoring, security hardening, and CI/CD generation
- [x] Integrate prompt-driven AI responses into existing recursive decomposition and feedback loop modules
- [x] Persist iterative outputs for long-term project memory and meta-evaluation
- [x] AIResponseCache that caches LLM results for a time-to-live
